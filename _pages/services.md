# About Our Collective

We specialize in **Platform Engineering** and the development of **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** that empower engineering teams to ship software efficiently. Our approach is vendor-independent, leveraging open-source technologies and the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) ecosystem** to create flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions.

{: .caution }
We consider Terraform to be an outdated solution, new implementations and new components are built on top of the Kubernetes engine.

***

# Our Value Proposition
We help organizations:
- **Accelerate Software Delivery**: Enable teams to deploy faster with self-service infrastructure.
- **Reduce Complexity**: Standardize workflows and tooling to streamline operations.
- **Enhance Developer Experience**: Provide intuitive interfaces and automation to eliminate friction in development.
- **Ensure Compliance & Security**: Implement best practices for governance, security, and observability.
- **Lower Costs & Increase Flexibility**: Avoid vendor lock-in with open-source solutions and cloud-native technologies.
- **Enable AI Agents**: Enable AI machinery on both sides: Internal Developer Platform engine and in the IDP User space
