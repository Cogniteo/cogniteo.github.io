# Comparative Architecture Analysis

This Comparison Matrix is designed to provide a strategic overview of the key architectural differences between three primary platform archetypes:

- Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
- General Application Platforms (Platform-as-a-Service - PaaS)
- AI-Native Platforms

The matrix aims to assist technical leaders, architects, and product managers in understanding the fundamental trade-offs, core components, and primary use cases that dictate the architecture of each system.
